# FOSS Guides (Work in progress)

Let's make Catena-X foss (Free opensource software)

If you have any questions, please contact **NOT YET FILLEDOUT**

## Motivation

If you write code and say nothing about the terms of use
=> **nobody** except you can use it.

In general, if there is code in a (public) repo without any declaration of the terms of use and copyright statements
=> nobody except the copyright holders can use it, and ownership is unclear

Putting the code under an open source license is a solution.
Open Source Licenses are **contracts** that define (among other things) the terms of use.

A distinction is made between:

* self written code
* 3rd party libraries

### Self written code

Put the code under an open source license
AND add to all source files a copyright and license header (when technically feasible).

### 3rd party libraries

If you use 3rd party libraries to run your code, you have to be compliant
with the according license (remember: OSS licenses are contracts).
