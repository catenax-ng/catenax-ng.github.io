## Can I have 'admin' privileges on my catenax-ng repository?

__Short answer:__ No! Administrative tasks will be performed by the team managing the GitHub organization.

__Long answer:__ The GitHub organizatoin is managed by a dedicated team. This team also works closely together with the
security expert group and the release manager. Together we need to ensure, that product teams and repositories are best
prepared for going open-source in the eclipse foundation. We also need to ensure, that mandatory quality gates are
checked

__In case you want to change configuration that needs administrative privileges:__ Get in touch with us and explain what
you need to change and why. You can create
a [support request](https://jira.catena-x.net/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=10212&issuetype=10401&components=10401&priority=3&summary=blank%20template%20for%20any%20requirement&description=%0AGitHub%20user%3A%20_your_user_%0Ablank_template&labels=requirement-dependent),
