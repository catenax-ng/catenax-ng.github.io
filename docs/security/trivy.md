# Trivy

We **scan containers** with Trivy.

Add the following GitHub action _trivy.yml_ to your repository workflows.

In order for Trivy to scan the correct GitHub packages, they must be specified in the action.

Integration steps per GitHub package:

1. Copy job `analyze-<REPLACE-ME container name\>`

2. Replace the name of the job with the name of the GitHub package - green box.

3. Replace `image-ref` with the yellow box of the GitHub package.

:::info

In order to always scan the latest GitHub package, a tag (red box) must be set for the packages and specified in the `image-ref`.
