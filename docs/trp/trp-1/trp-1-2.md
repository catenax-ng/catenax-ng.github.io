## Description

No admin privileges will be granted to GitHub teams for repositories.

## Why

The GitHub organization is managed by a dedicated team. This team also works closely together with the
security expert group and the release manager. Together we need to ensure, that product teams and repositories are best
prepared for going open-source in the eclipse foundation. We also need to ensure, that mandatory quality gates are
checked

__In case you want to change configuration that needs administrative privileges__:  
Get in touch with System Team and explain what you need to change and why. You can create
a [support request](https://jira.catena-x.net/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=10212&issuetype=10401&components=10401&priority=3&summary=blank%20template%20for%20any%20requirement&description=%0AGitHub%20user%3A%20_your_user_%0Ablank_template&labels=requirement-dependent)
