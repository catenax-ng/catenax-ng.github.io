## Introduction

Welcome to Tractus-X Release Guidelines, known as TRGs. TRG numbers are assigned by the TRG
editors, and once assigned never changed. The version control history of the TRG texts represent their historical
record. The TRGs are indexed by topic for specialist subjects.

Potential new TRGs won't be published here, but in

Please update your bookmarks and always check
the [Eclipse-Tractusx Release Guidlines website](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release)
