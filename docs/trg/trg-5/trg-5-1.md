## Description

All Catena-X/ Tractus-X components must be installable via HELM and meet following requirements:

- HELM chart must be released.
- Use appropriate versioning for `version` and `appVersion` in `Chart.yaml`.
- The released HELM chart shall not contain any environment specific `values-xyz.yaml` files.
- HELM chart `values.yaml` file must contain all values the chart will expect.
- HELM dependencies have to be declared in `Charts.yaml` file.

## Why

### Released HELM Charts

Tractus-X components can only be used and bundled with other components of Tractus-X if there is a version of the
component with reliable content. This can only be achieved by creating a release of your HELM chart. Please refer to [_
How to release a Helm Chart_](../../guides/how-to-release-a-helm-chart.md) and [_How to be part of the Release Umbrella
Helm Chart_](../../guides/how-to-be-part-of-release-umbrella-helm.md).

### Versioning

Versioning is essential when it comes to releasing HELM charts. In an ideal world your chart Version (defined
in `version` inside `Chart.yaml`) match the application version (defined in `appVersion` inside `Chart.yaml`) which the
HELM chart will deploy. This makes it for users easier to get and idea what will be installed in which version. Please
refer also to [_TRG 5.03 - Version Strategy_](trg-5-3.md).

To achieve a proper versioning of your HELM chart keep in mind, that it shall not contain version information that could
change outside the HELM chart, e.g. conatiner image tags (â†’ don't use container image tag _latest_).

### The `value.yaml` File

The `values.yaml` file is essential for HELM charts. The file must contain all values the chart is expecting and there
must no other values files except of `values.yaml` file. Released HELM charts must contain only `values.yaml` file.

### Dependencies

If a HELM chart has dependencies to other HELM charts, e.g. PostgreSQL, these dependencies must be specified in
the `Charts.yaml` file. Do not use outdated `requirements.yaml`.
