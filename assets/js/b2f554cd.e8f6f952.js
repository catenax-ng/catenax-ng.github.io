Discussed different approaches, from developer sight and OPs sight.\\n- Off-boarding Eclipse  \\n  Is there an off-boarding process if a developer (in this Eclipse Committer) leaves the Catena-X/Eclipse-Tractus-X\\n  project?\\n  - In general, Eclipse Tractus-X Project Leads (Daniel Miehle/ Bj\xf6rn Roy) can easily revoke Committer permissions.\\n  - This shall never happen without knowledge to the Committer.\\n  - For off-boarding, get in contact with the Committer and one of the project leads to clarify revoking the committer\\n    rights.\\n  - It would be also very polite to announce this to our dev mailing list to let the other committers know.\\n- Is there a default for projects repos structure (having a mono repo vs. split up to several repos (frontend, backend,\\n  charts, ...))\\n  - Currently, there is no recommendation, and it\'s up to the developers how to organize their repo(s).\\n  - Our TRGs tries to follow for what you have decided. If there is more than one repo, than we expect a so-called\\n    leading repository, which points out to all repos associated to the product.\\n  - Anglika: The barrier should be as low as possible to get an idea if there is only one, or more repos.\\n- How to contribute to [eclipse-tractusx.github.io](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io)?\\n  - There are discussion in background about organizing the website.\\n  - Best approach is to work on a branch, or, if your are not a committer, fork the repo, and contribute to upstream\\n    providing pull requests.\\n\\n## Session recording\\n\\nYou can find the\\nrecording [here](https://bcgcatenax.sharepoint.com/:v:/r/sites/CommunitiesofPractises/Shared%20Documents/CX-CoP%20DevSecOps/Office_Hours_Regular_Recordings/20230203_DevSecOPs%20Business%20Hours-Recording.mp4?csf=1&web=1&e=IJnVb8)."},{"id":"Office Hours 2023-01-27","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Office Hours 2023-01-27","editUrl":"https://github.com/catenax-ng/catenax-ng.github.io/blog/2023-01-27-OfficeHours.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-01-27-OfficeHours.md","title":"Office Hours 2023-01-27","description":"General updates / information","date":"2023-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 27, 2023","tags":[{"label":"news","permalink":"/blog/tags/news"},{"label":"officehour","permalink":"/blog/tags/officehour"}],"readingTime":1.43,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"DevSecOps Team","title":"Your DevSecOps enabler","url":"https://github.com/catenax-ng","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/100771185?s=200&v=4","key":"DevSecOps"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"Office Hours 2023-01-27","title":"Office Hours 2023-01-27","authors":"DevSecOps","tags":["news","officehour"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Office Hours 2023-02-03","permalink":"/blog/Office Hours 2023-02-03"},"nextItem":{"title":"Office Hours 2023-01-20","permalink":"/blog/Office Hours 2023-01-20"}},"content":"## General updates / information\\n\\n### DevSecOps\\n\\n- Documentation Updates\\n  -

This is __MANDATORY__ to be part of Release 2.0\\n\\n## General updates\\n\\nThe following updates were presented:\\n\\n- The cosign (signing docker images) step in k8s-helm-example was outdated. New version published and further investigations will follow\\n- In the following days, we will provide examples on how you can test and lint your helm charts in a GitHub workflow\\n\\n## Open discussions\\n\\nThe following topics where discussed in the open session:\\n\\n- Is there already guidance on day-to-day working model, once our code passed the initial contribution check to the eclipse foundation?\\n  - No official and complete guidance yet\\n  - Start with the initial contribution process as soon as possible\\n  - During the e2e test phase for release two, we will most likely have repositories exist in catenax-ng and eclipse-tractusx in parallel\\n  - Once the initial contribution is done, the DevSecOps team will work on integrating the checks from catenax-ng (i.e. VeraCode) to eclipse-tractusx aswell\\n  - After that, you can use the eclipse-tractusx repository as leading one and only catenax-ng for consoritia environment specific deployment configuration\\n- Are there additional best-practices for Helm releases?\\n  - External dependencies that are copied to your own repo -> Discouraged due to FOSS licensing concerns. Get in touch, if you need further details and guidance\\n  - Versioning\\n    - Try to keep your git tags, docker image tags and helm chart version tag in sync\\n    - Release your chart together with your application to make that easier\\n    - Changes in your application should also lead to changes in your helm chart. At least the image tag in the values.yaml as default config should change"},{"id":"Office Hours 2022-06-17","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Office Hours 2022-06-17","editUrl":"https://github.com/catenax-ng/catenax-ng.github.io/blog/2022-06-17-OfficeHours.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-06-17-OfficeHours.md","title":"Office Hours 2022-06-17","description":"In our today\'s office hours, we discussed the following topics","date":"2022-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 17, 2022","tags":[{"label":"news","permalink":"/blog/tags/news"},{"label":"officehour","permalink":"/blog/tags/officehour"}],"readingTime":0.895,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"DevSecOps Team","title":"Your DevSecOps enabler","url":"https://github.com/catenax-ng","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/100771185?s=200&v=4","key":"DevSecOps"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"Office Hours 2022-06-17","title":"Office Hours 2022-06-17","authors":"DevSecOps","tags":["news","officehour"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Office Hours 2022-8-26","permalink":"/blog/Office Hours 2022-8-26"},"nextItem":{"title":"Office Hours 2022-06-10","permalink":"/blog/Office Hours 2022-06-10"}},"content":"In our today\'s office hours, we discussed the following topics\\r\\n\\r\\n1.

How do you work with Secrets and ArgoCD? -> Currently you send your secrets manually to us and we will apply it in your namespace. The vault integration is very close to finish, then you will be able to reference inside ArgoCD secrets from vault\\n   1. How to work with Helm dependencies? This was asked in context of how to seperate the catena-x specific helm chart and your product helm chart. The motivation for separation is to have not catena-x specific code in your repository -> There is no particular requirement to keep catena-x specifics out of your repository. Best practice might be to have a release process which removes all catena-x specific files (which would then also generate a documentation and other things)\\n1.
