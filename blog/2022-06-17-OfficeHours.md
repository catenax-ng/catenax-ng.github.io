In our today's office hours, we discussed the following topics

1. News from the DevSecOps Team
    1. We now have now support for login into vault directly by using GitHub (you don't need to create a github token anymore!)
    2. Grafana is now provided/enabled on all environments (currently dev and int exist): [grafana.int.demo.catena-x.net](https://grafana.int.demo.catena-x.net) OR [grafana.dev.demo.catena-x.net](https://grafana.dev.demo.catena-x.net); You want to know how to use it to check your CPU and Memory usage? Go to our [new guide](/docs/guides/how-to-monitor) to see how.
    3. We removed admin permissions from a few repositories: Be aware that we gave out admin permissions by accident. Currently we guardrail repositories so that release mandatory security checks can't be overriden. If you need support on adding a secret for example, make sure to get in contact with us and we will help you.
2. News from the Security Team
    1. No update today
3. News from the FOSS Team
    1. New udpates on the [foss-example](https://github.com/catenax-ng/foss-example) repository! There are now basic files you can already add to your catena-x based repository.
4. Q&A
5. Hands-on
