## General updates / information

### DevSecOps

- Configuring the Eclipse Tractus-X GitHub organization is available through the [eclipsefdn](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/.eclipsefdn) repository. The tool behind it is called [Otterdog](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/security/otterdog) and the current configuration and available settings, organization secrets and more can be found [here](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/.eclipsefdn/configuration/). Opening a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-infra/issues/new/choose) with a request for the System Team is still supported.

### Security

- Security Team is getting ready for Quality Gate. Every team is encouraged to look at the security issues in time to have them fixed before the reviews.

### FOSS

- Each opened Eclipse Matrix chat room and thread needs a maintainer or a person responsible for answering questions/for requests there.
- EclipseCon will take place in October 16 - 19, 2023. Multiple people from the community will be there and also will host talks. Discounts are available for committers and member companies.

## Open discussions

- [SwaggerHub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/search) is used now to publish APIs from EDC in Eclipse Tractusx and also from the upstream EDC project. Different tools like maven plugins can be used to combine mulitple yaml files that can be posted in the end. The whole process can be put into a GitHub workflow with specifying some secrets for accessing SwaggerHub.
- A great demo was presented on how to handle postgres credentials in a helm chart when introduced as a dependency. It is available in detail [in the recording starting at 26:56](https://bcgcatenax.sharepoint.com/sites/CommunitiesofPractises/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?FolderCTID=0x01200075F4DD2D705FA349B372CD3378FD1093&id=%2Fsites%2FCommunitiesofPractises%2FShared%20Documents%2FCX%2DCoP%20DevSecOps%2FOffice%5FHours%5FRegular%5FRecordings%2F20230811%5FDevSecOps%20Business%20Hours%2DRecording%2Emp4&parent=%2Fsites%2FCommunitiesofPractises%2FShared%20Documents%2FCX%2DCoP%20DevSecOps%2FOffice%5FHours%5FRegular%5FRecordings).
