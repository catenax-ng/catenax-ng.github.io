## Open discussions

- TRG for versioning Tractus-X APIs
  - See the [open PR](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/eclipse-tractusx.github.io/pull/526) for discussions
  - Potential issues regarding external dependencies/protocols, that we don't control, as well as versioning implementations, that would need to be adapted
  - Basic agreement, that APIs need to be versioned
  - Not yet agreed, if the technical details should be defined as TRG, or it will keep being the choice of the products
  - Discussions and agreements need to take place in Eclipse Tractus-X
  - Current suggestions: Define exceptions or document as best-practice instead of release guideline
