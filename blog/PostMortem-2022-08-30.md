### Authors

Carsten Lenz, Mercedes-Benz Tech Innovation GmbH

### Status

Solved

### Summary

Outgoing internet traffic on Azure AKS clusters was blocked. As a result, pulling images in our environments did not
work.

### Impact

All Catena-X AKS clusters were affected by this issue.

### Root Causes

Microsoft deployed a defective systemd version to AKS clusters, which blocked outgoing internet traffic.

### Resolution

We have been in contact with MS Azure support starting 30.08.2022. During 31.08.2022 we received a temporary solution
from MS support, which was applied to all our AKS clusters. Afterwards our clusters recovered and image pulling was
possible again.

## Action Items

None, as this was a global MS Azure AKS related incident.
