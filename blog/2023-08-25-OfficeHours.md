  Please do not reference closed systems like Catena-X Consortia Jira Tickets. The content is no public accessible but
  only for consortia members. Please be descriptive in your Commit messages and Pull Request descriptions.
- Do not invent new legal documentation (e.g. `COPYRIGHT.md`), please
  follow [TRG 7.01 - Legal Documentation](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release/trg-7/trg-7-01)
- Documentation and licensing  
  Be careful with licensing your documentation (e.g. content of `/docs` folder in product repositories). There is no
  requirement to change the licensing of documentation to e.g. Creative Commons, there has been some confusion about in
  the
  past. [TRG 7-06 - Legal notice for end user content](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release/trg-7/trg-7-06/)
  contains an example how to add a notice section.
- HasiCorp moved from Mozilla Public License v2.0 (MPL 2.0) to the Business Source License (BSL, or BUSL) v1.1 for
  future releases of all products and several libraries. Please
  use [this GH Discussion](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-infra/discussions/233) to give feedback if your
  product has dependencies to HashiCorp products or not.
