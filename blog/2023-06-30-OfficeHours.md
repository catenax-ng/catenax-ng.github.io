## General updates / information

### DevSecOps

- Currently working on automated release guideline checks
- Goal is to create reusable workflows and actions
- Potentially coming with this is automated GitHub release creation workflows
- Kind request: In case you face issues or have questions about EF processes, like the ECA check, or you do not know how to fix issues with the ECA check,
  consider opening a support issue on [sig-infra](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-infra).
  These are issues, that we most likely already faced and solved. It can also help to reduce the workload on the EF.

### Security

- New [SECURITY.md](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release/trg-7/trg-7-01/#security-file) file, that emphasizes GitHub security advisories
- Announcement: Next week, Veracode will showcase their new product "Veracode Fix" in the office hour

### FOSS

- Reminder: There is a Mail on the tractus-x-dev mailing list, asking for anyone feeling responsible for currently uninitialized repositories (10 repos currently)
- Please make sure, that you initialize repositories at least with the legal documentation, after you requested them from the EF
- Kind request: Please share improvements, that you achieved together with the EF, since they might be relevant for others as well. Thanks, Paul for doing this with the "public to maven central" workflow!

## Open discussions

- Question regarding [TRG 7.07](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release/trg-7/trg-7-07); CC-BY-4.0 vs, Apache-2.0 license
  - There are parts in the consortial contract, that are dedicated to a use of CC-BY-4.0 for documentation
  - It is not clearly defined, what kind of documentation this is refering to
  - The decision might have to be made on a product and maybe even on a document basis
  - Stay tuned for potential updates. We are working on clarification.
- Specific support, in case you want to look into the recording
  - Issue configuring environment specific values for a Chart in Argo CD
  - Dashboards in Grafana instances
