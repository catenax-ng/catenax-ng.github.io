## General updates / information

### DevSecOps / System-Team

- Docker base image alignment
  - Potentially, we won't publish all of our Docker images to DockerHub
  - We are working on docs for it
  - We will introduce "ignore" options for our automated TRG checks
- New support request template "Add me as Tractus-X project contributor"
- Matrix Chat room icons
  - Poll concluded with mostly "don't care" responses
  - If no one cares, we should maybe stick with the current icons. Least effort, IP already clear

### Security

- GitGuardian License prolonged
- Working on a Snyk License for Tractus-X together with Eclipse Foundation
- Security assessments will be migrated from Confluence to GitHub
- Working on a bug bounty program

### FOSS

- Ongoing and new committer elections: Please vote and spread the word
- Reminder: Tractus-X Community Days 07. + 08. Dec

## Open discussions

- Does "compiled" documentation also need legal docs? -> Yes, but might be interesting to discuss the specific cases
- Should we migrate existing GitHub Wiki documentation to Markdown -> Yes
  - Wikis can only be edited by committers
  - No PRs possible
  - An additional source of docs, that makes it hard to find
- General discussion about planning and linking issues/sub-tasks/stories
  - Planning should all be done in eclipse-tractusx
  - Linking issues can be done in comments, so no contributor or committer privileges necessary
  - "sub-tasks" of any sorts can/should be created on component repo, where changes are done
