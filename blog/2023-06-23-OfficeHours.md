### Security

- Ongoing security assessments (MIW, SSI).
- Please check your Veracode for findings and vulnerabilities as there has been some finding.
- Penetration test for Portal will start in july.

### FOSS

- Committer election for Phil and Enrico. Both introduced themselves and Angelika encouraged all Committers to vote.
- As we're expecting new Committers,
  the [Eclipse-Tractus-X Developer Hub](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/developer) was mentioned and the
  importance of our [TRGs](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release).
- Use the [Eclipse Matrix chat](https://chat.eclipse.org/) to communicate and to ask questions, e.g. related
  to [IP issues](https://matrix.to/#/#eclipsefdn.ip-license-compliance:matrix.eclipse.org). There is also
  a [room for Eclipse-Tractus-X](https://matrix.to/#/#tools.tractus-x:matrix.eclipse.org).
- Next Catena-X will hit holiday season in August. Keep in mind, that resources at Eclipse Foundation (IP-Team),
  System-Team and Security-Team will have only limited resources available during holiday season.
- Repositories in Eclipse-Tractus-X should not stay for a long time in an uninitialized state, or without reasonable
  content. Take care of your repositories.

## Open discussions

- Problems with ECA checks and issues to rewrite the Git history with the correct email-address. Issue will be clarified
  in a dedicated 101 session.
- Questions/discussions about how to use GitHub Projects and working with milestones. This is an ongoing task. In case
  of additional questions feel free to get in touch with Fabian from System-Team, who is in the lead with this topic.
