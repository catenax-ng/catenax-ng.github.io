## Open discussions

- How to retrieve and send data to the Golden Record? -> Recommended to contact BPDM team directly as it's product specific question.
- Introduction on GitHub Webeditor was given
- Explained the concern around checks highlights in the quality dashboard, the way it works is that if it doesn't find an element i.e. charts directory it marks the check green. If it finds issues within charts then reports it red.
- Is someone aware of actions creating pull requests? Question related to automating creation of svg files from PUML and usage of the artifacts by bot. Advise is to extend the workflow with additional git commands (add & commit). There is a concern around bot commits verification, that needs to be discussed with Eclipse Foundation.
